When dealing with inventory management, you want to reduce the amount of work it requires ideally to zero. Automating your inventory could be a big part of it and at [organization.supply](https://organization.supply) we aim to do that without as much effort or a big amount of money. 

We've got quite a few ideas about how to automate:

*   Connecting with e-commerce stores
*   API interface with financial software (a sale most of the time also represents movement in inventory)
*   Shortcuts for selling etc with a friendly interface (often move a same amount to a certain location? Why not create a shortcut for it?)
*   And in the future, we might even start to recognize patters and suggest things!

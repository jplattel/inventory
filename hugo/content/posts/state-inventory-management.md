Lets talk about the current state of inventory management. It's a bit sad, and if you make a mental figure, you can see someone labeling in a boring dusty office. Inventory management isn't pretty and it's hard to improve it. But thats our goal! 

We want to fix the old world of inventory software and look towards to future. Imagine a future where keeping track of inventory is done automatically! Wouldn't that be awesome?
